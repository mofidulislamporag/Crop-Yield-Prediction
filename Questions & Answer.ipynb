    "# 1. Data Loading & Exploration\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('crop_yield.csv')\n",
    "print(f\"Dataset shape: {df.shape}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Missing values: {df.isnull().sum()}\")\n",

    "### Q4: Why did you choose the specific models you implemented?\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Click for answer</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "models = {\n",
    "    'Random Forest': RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42),\n",
    "    'Gradient Boosting': GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42),\n",
    "    'Linear Regression': LinearRegression(),\n",
    "    'Ridge Regression': Ridge(alpha=1.0)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reasoning:**\n",
    "- **Random Forest**: Handles mixed data types well, robust to outliers, provides feature importance\n",
    "- **Gradient Boosting**: Often higher performance, good with non-linear relationships\n",
    "- **Linear Models**: Baseline models, interpretable coefficients\n",
    "- **Ridge Regression**: Handles multicollinearity better than vanilla linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results:** Random Forest performed best with RÂ² ~0.85, balancing performance and interpretability.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5: How did you evaluate model performance?\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Click for answer</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Evaluation Metrics Implementation\n",
    "def evaluate_model(y_true, y_pred, model_name):\n",
    "    mae = mean_absolute_error(y_true, y_pred)\n",
    "    mse = mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred)\n",
    "    rmse = np.sqrt(mse)\n",
    "    r2 = r2_score(y_true, y_pred)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    print(f\"{model_name} Results:\")\n",
    "    print(f\"  MAE: {mae:.4f}\")\n",
    "    print(f\"  RMSE: {rmse:.4f}\")\n",
    "    print(f\"  RÂ² Score: {r2:.4f}\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return {'MAE': mae, 'RMSE': rmse, 'R2': r2}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metric Selection Rationale:**\n",
    "- **RÂ²**: Overall model fit and variance explained\n",
    "- **RMSE**: Interpretable in original units (tons/hectare), penalizes large errors\n",
    "- **MAE**: Robust metric, less sensitive to outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validation Strategy:** 80-20 train-test split with random state for reproducibility.\n",

    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Click for answer</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** My feature engineering approach included:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Categorical Encoding**:\n",
    "   - Used Label Encoding for tree-based models\n",
    "   - Considered but didn't use One-Hot Encoding to avoid high dimensionality\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Boolean Conversion**:\n",
    "   - Converted True/False to 1/0 for ML compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Selection**:\n",
    "   - Used all available features initially\n",
    "   - Later analyzed feature importance for insights\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scaling**:\n",
    "   - Applied StandardScaler for linear models\n",
    "   - Tree-based models used unscaled features\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Feature Importance Analysis (Random Forest)\n",
    "feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({\n",
    "    'feature': feature_columns,\n",

    "### Q7: How did you handle potential overfitting?\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Click for answer</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** I implemented several anti-overfitting measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Train-Test Split**: 80-20 split to evaluate generalization\n",
    "2. **Ensemble Methods**: Random Forest naturally reduces overfitting\n",
    "3. **Regularization**: Used Ridge Regression for linear models\n",
    "4. **Cross-Validation**: Implemented CV scores for robustness check\n",
    "5. **Feature Analysis**: Monitored feature importance for relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Cross-validation example\n",
    "cv_scores = cross_val_score(rf_model, X_train, y_train, cv=5, scoring='r2')\n",
    "print(f\"CV RÂ² Scores: {cv_scores}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Mean CV RÂ²: {cv_scores.mean():.4f} (+/- {cv_scores.std() * 2:.4f})\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The small gap between training and test performance indicated good generalization.\n",

    "### Q8: What was your approach to hyperparameter tuning?\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Click for answer</summary>\n",

    "    'min_samples_split': [2, 5],\n",
    "    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2]\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Simple grid search implementation\n",
    "best_score = 0\n",
    "best_params = {}\n",
    "for n_est in rf_params['n_estimators']:\n",
    "    for depth in rf_params['max_depth']:\n",
    "        model = RandomForestRegressor(\n",
    "            n_estimators=n_est,\n",
    "            max_depth=depth,\n",
    "            random_state=42\n",
    "        )\n",
    "        model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "        score = model.score(X_test, y_test)\n",

    "            best_params = {'n_estimators': n_est, 'max_depth': depth}\n",
    "```\n",
